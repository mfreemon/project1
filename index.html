    			  Thanks for taking some time out to view one of my first projects. The goal here is to simple create a single page application<em></em>xperimenting with features that have caught my attention on other sites and wanted to practice building myself. This site will serve
               as my test site for screwing around building out cool features. So check back ever so often to see what's changed.
